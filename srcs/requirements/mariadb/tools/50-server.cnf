# * Basic Settings
#



# [42_inception]: user 옵션 활성화
# root가 아닌 mysql이라는 사용자로 실행함
user                    = mysql
basedir                 = /usr


# [42_inception]: datadir 지시어를 활성화하여 데이터베이스 파일이 저장될 위치를 명시함
# Docker와 마운트를 위해 필수적임
datadir                 = /var/lib/mysql
# [42_inception]: tmpdir 옵션 활성화
# 임시파일 저장 위치를 명시하고, 큰 쿼리나 정렬 시 임시 공간을 사용하도록 하기 위함
tmpdir                  = /tmp

# Broken reverse DNS slows down connections considerably and name resolve is
# safe to skip if there are no "host by domain name" access grants
#skip-name-resolve

# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.

# [42_inception] : 127.0.0.1 -> 0.0.0.0으로 변경
# 해당 컨테이너가 Docker 네트워크와 통신을 위해 수정 필요
bind-address            = 0.0.0.0

# * Fine Tuning

#key_buffer_size        = 128M
#max_allowed_packet     = 1G
#thread_stack           = 192K
#thread_cache_size      = 8
# This replaces the startup script and checks MyISAM tables if needed
# the first time they are touched
#myisam_recover_options = BACKUP
#max_connections        = 100
#table_cache            = 64

#
# * Logging and Replication
#

# Note: The configured log file or its directory need to be created
# and be writable by the mysql user, e.g.:
# $ sudo mkdir -m 2750 /var/log/mysql
# $ sudo chown mysql /var/log/mysql

# Both location gets rotated by the cronjob.
# Be aware that this log type is a performance killer.
# Recommend only changing this at runtime for short testing periods if needed!
#general_log_file       = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log
#general_log            = 1

# When running under systemd, error logging goes via stdout/stderr to journald
# and when running legacy init error logging goes to syslog due to
# /etc/mysql/conf.d/mariadb.conf.d/50-mysqld_safe.cnf
# Enable this if you want to have error logging into a separate file
#log_error = /var/log/mysql/error.log
# Enable the slow query log to see queries with especially long duration
#log_slow_query_file    = /var/log/mysql/mariadb-slow.log
#log_slow_query_time    = 10
#log_slow_verbosity     = query_plan,explain
#log-queries-not-using-indexes
#log_slow_min_examined_row_limit = 1000

# The following can be used as easy to replay backup logs or for replication.
# note: if you are setting up a replication slave, see README.Debian about
#       other settings you may need to change.
#server-id              = 1
#log_bin                = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
expire_logs_days        = 10
#max_binlog_size        = 100M

#
# * SSL/TLS
#

# For documentation, please read
# https://mariadb.com/kb/en/securing-connections-for-client-and-server/
#ssl-ca = /etc/mysql/cacert.pem
#ssl-cert = /etc/mysql/server-cert.pem
#ssl-key = /etc/mysql/server-key.pem
#require-secure-transport = on

#
# * Character sets
#

# MySQL/MariaDB default is Latin1, but in Debian we rather default to the full
# utf8 4-byte character set. See also client.cnf
character-set-server  = utf8mb4
collation-server      = utf8mb4_general_ci

#
# * InnoDB
#

# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!
# Most important is to give InnoDB 80 % of the system RAM for buffer use:
# https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-system-variables/#innodb_buffer_pool_size
#innodb_buffer_pool_size = 8G

# this is only for embedded server
[embedded]

# This group is only read by MariaDB servers, not by MySQL.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MySQL and MariaDB,
# you can put MariaDB-only options here
[mariadb]

# This group is only read by MariaDB-10.11 servers.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MariaDB of different versions,
# use this group for options that older servers don't understand
[mariadb-10.11]
